        <h2>Binary Sections</h2>

        <p>
            A section is basically the smallest chunk of a binary that the Windows OS Loader cares about.  Each section in a binary has so-called 
            <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-image_section_header">"characteristics"</a> which define
            things like whether that section contains executable code, contains read-only data or read-write data, and whether that section
            contains initialized or uninitialized data.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            When the binary is loaded into a process, the loader will ensure that everything not marked executable in these headers is in fact
            never executed, these days this often uses a hardware <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NX_bit">NX-bit</a> for security, for
            example.  Similarly, the OS will enforce that read-only sections never get written to as you would expect.
        </p>

        <p>
            The OS can only accomplish this by ensuring sections occupy whole pages of memory.  On Windows, these pages are 4KB, so if a section
            contains, say, 1,096 bytes of code - then when loaded into memory an additional 3,000 bytes of memory will be allocated and zero'd out
            to fill up the full 4,096 bytes (4 KB) of that page.  Likewise, if a section contains 4,100 bytes of read-only data then it will need
            to occupy 8,192 bytes (8 KB) of space across two pages, resulting in 4,092 bytes (8,192 - 4,100) of zero padding.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sections can be very coarse and challenging to really understand in full, especially in large binaries.  If you want to dig in deeper
            than a section, your next step is to break down the section by <a href="coff-group.html">COFF Groups</a>,
            which give more semantic meaning to chunks that have the same OS-loader-level capabilities, and are all grouped into the same section.

        <h3>Commonly-seen section name decoder ring</h3>
        <p>
            One thing that makes sections tricky to talk about is that their names are just by convention.  For example, the name <tt>.text</tt> is,
            by convention, used to hold the code in a binary commonly.  But nothing stops you from picking another one.  For example, many kernel-mode
            binaries choose the name <tt>PAGE</tt> for their page-able code and place non-pageable code in another section.<br/>
            <br/>
            As a result of this all being by convention, we can't easily just say "if you want to find all of your code, look in <tt>.text</tt>" and
            instead need to see all of these obtuse/arcane names directly in tools like SizeBench.  To aid with that, here is a "decoder ring" with some
            commonly-seen sections in the wild, and what they mean in human-readable words.
        </p>

                    Reduce data you don't need, or move it to .rdata to make it shareable.  To move to .rdata see if you can mark more things constexpr (or const, in some cases) or make
                    them simple POD (plain old data) types.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Look for large arrays of data, for example, and see if each instance in the array might have padding waste with SizeBench's <a href="type-layout.html">Type Layout</a> view.<br/>
                    Reducing <a href="dynamic-initializers.html">dynamic initializers</a> can also move data from .data to .rdata.

        <h3>Other tools you can use</h3>
        <p>
            If you want to explore sections there are lots of tools available, as this file format has existed for decades.  The MSVC Linker (link.exe)
            is a good one.  You can execute a command like this:
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
            <tt>link /dump /headers path\to\your\binary.dll</tt>
        </p>

        <p>
            And you will see output like this for each section:
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
            <pre>
    SECTION HEADER #1
    .text name
   9CC879 virtual size
     1000 virtual address (0000000180001000 to 00000001809CD878)
   9CCA00 size of raw data
      400 file pointer to raw data (00000400 to 009CCDFF)
        0 file pointer to relocation table
        0 file pointer to line numbers
        0 number of relocations
        0 number of line numbers
 60000020 flags
          Code
          Execute Read
            </pre>
        </p>

        <p>
            The name of the section above is <tt>.text</tt> and you can see its size and various properties.  At the end of the <tt>link /dump</tt> output is a
            summary table that looks like this, showing every section's size at a glance (note the values are in hex):
        </p>

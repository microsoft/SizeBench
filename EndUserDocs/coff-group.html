        <h2>COFF Groups</h2>

        <p>
            A COFF Group is a named contiguous 'chunk' of a <a href="binary-section.html">binary section</a>.  All COFF Groups in a section share the same set of
            characteristics such as being executable or read-only or read-write.  What they offer is a name that helps semantically understand a section at the
            next level of detail.
        </p>

        <img class="screenshot" src="Images/Size_vs_VirtualSize.png" width=800/>
        <p>
            When the OS loads a binary into memory, these COFF Groups get expanded in memory, as shown in the diagram to the right.  The COFF Groups
            are sorted, by the linker, so they exist in alphabetical order within their parent section in the binary.  The exception is for COFF Groups that exist
            in-memory but not on-disk, those are always last so they can be materialized into the section padding.  When a COFF Group is mapped into the
            address space of a process, generally they will be mapped directly from disk as-is as a big continuous chunk of memory.  But sometimes, like
            with the <tt>.bss</tt> COFF Group, they don't exist on-disk and will be materialized when used, as zero-initialized pages, which you can also
            see in the diagram.
        </p>

        <p>
            For more details on the padding shown, see the page on <a href="binary-section.html">binary sections.</a>
        </p>

        <h3>Commonly-seen COFF Group name decoder ring</h3>
        <p>
            One thing that makes COFF Groups, like <a href="binary-section.html">sections</a>, tricky to talk about is that their names are just by convention
            in most cases.  For example, the <tt>.text</tt> section is, by convention, used to hold the code in a binary commonly, and thus all COFF Groups
            within the <tt>.text</tt> section are code.  But nothing stops you from picking your own names, and in fact several popular libraries define
            their own COFF Groups (such as the CRT, and WRL).<br/>
            <br/>
            As a result of this all being by convention, we can't easily just say "if you want to find all of your code, look in <tt>.text</tt>" and
            instead need to see all of these obtuse/arcane names directly in tools like SizeBench.  To aid with that, here is a "decoder ring" with some
            commonly-seen sections in the wild, and what they mean in human-readable words.  These are grouped by section since that's often how you'll
            navigate to a COFF Group in SizeBench's UI.

        <h3>Other tools you can use</h3>
        <p>
            If you want to explore COFF Groups there are some other tools available beyond SizeBench.  The MSVC Linker (link.exe) is a good one.  You can
            execute a command like this:
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
            <tt>link /dump /headers /coffgroup path\to\your\binary.dll</tt>
        </p>

        <p>
            You'll see a Debug Directory listed that has some COFF Groups with names like these (note that all sizes are in hex, as bytes):

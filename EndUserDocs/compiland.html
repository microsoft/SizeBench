        <h2>Compilands</h2>

        <p>
            A compiland is the term used in Windows PDB files for essentially an OBJ file - in C/C++ this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_unit_(programming)">translation unit</a>
            of content that gets linked into the final binary.
        </p>

        <p>
            SizeBench is capable of breaking a binary down by compiland, which can be a very useful way to investigate size as the filenames should be readily familiar as they correspond to the names
            of the c/cpp files that get compiled.  This familiarity, to someone familiar with a codebase, makes these names much more approachable than the more obtuse names for
            <a href="binary-section.html">binary sections</a> or <a href="coff-group.html">COFF Groups</a>.  There also tend to be many more of these in any reasonable-sized codebase, meaning this is
            a finer-grained way to break down size into more tractable units that a human can wrap their head around.  Sections and COFF Groups can be awfully big sometimes by comparison.

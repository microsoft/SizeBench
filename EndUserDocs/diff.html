        <h2>Features you can use when analyzing a diff</h2>

        <p>
            SizeBench has a variety of ways to help you break down a diff between two versions of a binary.  If you want to analyze just a single binary, see
            <a href="single-binary.html">analyzing a single binary.</a>
        </p>

        <p>Once you open a diff, there are three types of activities you can do:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>"Start Exploring By…" buttons</strong>, which let you explore the diff with various pivots, like looking at everything in an individual
                <a href="binary-section.html">Binary Section</a>, or an individual static lib. This is usually used when you want to optimize on-disk size or reference set,
                though you can see CPU perf benefits with smaller code or data.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>"Analyze Object Size" buttons</strong>, which let you explore the size of types in memory, visualize padding, and how vfptrs (pointers to vtables) add to
                size. Generally most useful when you want to try to use less memory at runtime, or you want to shrink a type that is frequently used (like in a large const/constexpr array).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>"Analyze For Waste" buttons</strong>, to run heuristic analyses for more actionable things you can do to reduce binary size, like reducing virtual function
                usage that is especially wasteful or data that is duplicated.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Start Exploring By Binary Section</h3>
        <p>
            This view lets you begin your exploration of the diff with a <a href="binary-section.html">Binary Sections</a>, so you can see how it changed between the two
            versions of the binary.  Sections are one of the coarsest ways of viewing the constituent parts of a binary, and are in turn composed of 
            <a href="coff-group.html">COFF Groups</a>. For example, the <tt>.text</tt> section may have a <tt>.text$mn</tt> COFF Group in it, or a <tt>.rdata</tt> section
            may have a <tt>.rdata$r</tt> COFF Group in it.<br />
            <br />
            When viewing an individual section, there are tabs in the UI to see all the COFF Groups within that section, all the static libs that contribute space to that section, all the
            <a href="compiland.html">compilands</a> that contribute space to that section, and all the symbols contained in the section.
        </p>

        <h3>Start Exploring By Lib</h3>
        <p>
            This view lets you begin your exploration with static libs contained in the binary - this is a less coarse view than <a href="binary-section.html">sections</a> or
            <a href="coff-group.html">COFF Groups</a> since usually you'll recognize the names a bit more and there are more of them in a typical binary.<br />
            <br />
            In the list of all libs, you can see every section and every COFF Group that they contribute to, and can reorder/sort those columns to help focus on specific problem areas.<br />
            <br />
            When viewing a specific lib, you can see all the binary sections, and COFF Groups that this lib contributes to (and how much this lib contributes into them). You can also see
            all the <a href="compiland.html">compilands</a> contained within the lib, and all the symbols in the lib.
        </p>

        <h3>Start Exploring By Compiland</h3>
        <p>
            This view lets you begin your exploration with <a href="compiland.html">"compilands"</a> contained in the binary. A compiland is essentially a Translation Unit in C++
            (one .obj file). These are even more granular than libs, <a href="coff-group.html">COFF Groups</a>, or <a href="binary-section.html">sections</a>, so they are a great place to
            jump in for a more detailed analysis. Plus you'll almost certainly know the names of these, they're usually the names of the source files that you build into the binary.<br />
            <br />
            When viewing the list of all compilands, just as with libs, you can see every section and every COFF Group that they contribute to, and can reorder/sort to focus.<br />
            <br />
            When viewing a specific compiland, you can see all the sections and COFF Groups that this compiland contributes to, and you can see all the symbols contained in that compiland.
        </p>

        <h3>Start Exploring By Source File</h3>
        <p>
            Coming soon!  Source files were recently added to single binary analyses, but diff functionality hasn't come about yet.
        </p>

        <h3>Type Layout</h3>
        <p>
            This view can show you a treeview-style layout of a type in your binary, which can help with optimizing the memory usage of an app in-memory.  If you know this type is used
            frequently at runtime this could amount to substantial memory improvements.  If you know this type is used in a large constant array in the binary, it could also reduce on-disk
            size.<br />
            <br />
            When viewing a type, you can see how much "waste" there is in the type layout in the form of alignment.<br />
            <br/>
            When doing a diff of type layouts, you'll see three tree views - the type before, the type after, and then a diff that shows removed members with a strikethrough.
            Members or base types that got smaller are green, and things that got bigger are red, to help spot where improvements or regressions are.
            <br />

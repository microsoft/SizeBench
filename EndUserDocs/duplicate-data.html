        <h2>Duplicate Data</h2>

        <p>
            In C++ it's sorta easy to accidentally cause data in a binary to be duplicated - strings, arrays, and the like. Rarely-to-never
            would you want this duplicated data to exist on-disk, but the standard requires it in some cases if you use keywords in ways
            you may not mean to. This is especially easy to do if coming from a background of C# or Java where '<tt>static</tt>' has a different meaning.
        </p>

        <p>
            SizeBench can detect when data is duplicated this way so you can quickly find these and de-dupe them, usually with very little work.
        </p>

        <h3>How Does Duplicate Data Happen?</h3>

        <p>
            Imagine you have code like this:
        </p>

        <pre>
    /* In SharedHeader.h */
    static const char* c_DuplicatedString = "This string has two copies in the binary - whoops!";

    /* In File1.cpp */
    ...in some code somewhere...
    CallSomeFunction(c_DuplicatedString);

    /* In File2.cpp */
    ...in some code somewhere...
    CallSomeFunction(c_DuplicatedString);
        </pre>

        <p>
            Then you've inadvertently created two copies of the data in c_DuplicatedString inside your binary. Why? Because each translation unit gets its
            own copy when it references this symbol. If you only reference the symbol in one translation unit then you're good - but in that case you may as
            well put it in that translation unit anyway instead of some shared header file.
        </p>

        <h3>Why doesn't the compiler/linker/whatever just fix this for me?</h3>

        <p>
            The C++ standard prevents it from doing so. If you use <tt>static const</tt> then each translation unit must get a unique copy - because the address
            of each one must be unique if you were to take it.  But honestly people rarely do that.
        </p>

        <h3>Example in SizeBench UI</h3>
        <img class="screenshot" src="Images/DuplicateData_Overview.png" width=800 />
        <p>
            If you click the "Duplicate Data" button after loading a binary in the tool, you'll get a screenshot similar to the right.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this case, this binary has just two pieces of duplicate data - <tt>duplicatedPointArray</tt> and <tt>duplicatedPoint</tt>.
        </p>

        <p>
            <tt>duplicatedPointArray</tt> is 24 bytes for each copy, and a total of 72 bytes of waste because as we'll see in a moment it's included in 4 translation
            units (one must store the data, 3 are unneeded duplicates). <tt>duplicatedPoint</tt> is only 8 bytes per copy, with a total of 24 bytes of waste, as it
            too is included in 4 translation units.
        </p>

        <br/>

        <img class="screenshot" src="Images/DuplicateData_duplicatedPointArray.png" width=800 />
        <p>
            If you click on <tt>duplicatedPointArray</tt> you'll see a view like this.
        </p>

        <p>
            This view will show you specifically which translation units have caused a copy of the data to be included - typically through some header they all pull in,
            though the details of exactly which source file caused this are unfortunately not recorded in the PDB so SizeBench can't tell you that.
        </p>

        <h3>How To Fix These</h3>

        <p>
            If the data is marked as <tt>static const</tt>, then just removing <tt>static</tt> is often enough to de-dupe the data. static in C++ requires a unique
            copy in each translation unit by the standard, so just don't request that. I'm not sure why, but in some cases instead you'll want to use
            <tt>extern __declspec(selectany) const</tt> to fully convince MSVC to de-dupe the data. If anyone knows why this is required in some cases, please let me know
            so I can update these docs!
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that the <tt>extern __declspec(selectany) const</tt> method means you need to be sure each copy really has the same data at build time - no funky macro
            expansions or <tt>#ifdef</tt> shenanigans that cause different versions to show up. The <tt>__declspec(selectany)</tt> tells the linker it can select any one
            copy of the symbol with this name and let it win (hence the name "selectany") so if they contain different data only one of those versions will make it into
            the resulting binary. But you really shouldn't have the same name with different data in different translation units anyway, that's confusing to begin with,
            so for most binaries this isn't a significant concern.
        </p>

        <p>
            For <tt>constexpr</tt> or <tt>static constexpr</tt> variables, you can instead use the <tt>inline constexpr</tt> syntax if you are using C++17 or later.  This
            will cause these readonly variables to combine into a single copy in the final binary.

        <h2>Template Foldability</h2>

        <p>
            One of the heuristic analyses that SizeBench can do is to look for C++ templated functions that are ripe for opportunities
            because they are 'almost COMDAT-foldable'.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the Core Idea of Template Foldability?</h3>

        <p>
            Suppose you have this template:
        </p>

        <pre>
    template <typename T>
    void MyCoolTemplate(T y, bool shouldBeEvenCooler)
    {
       if(shouldBeEvenCooler) { cout &lt;&lt; "I'm even cooler!"; return; }

       cout &lt;&lt; y-&gt;someField;
    }
        </pre>

        <p>
            One question you may have is just "how much size does <tt>MyCoolTemplate&lt;T&gt;</tt> contribute to my binary?" - as this is
            not at all obvious from reading the code. It depends on many factors, such as how many times the template was instantiated,
            and whether the linker's Identical COMDAT Folding (ICF) feature was able to fold any of these instantiations together.
        </p>

        <p>
            Imagine you use <tt>MyCoolTemplate&lt;Type1&gt;</tt>, <tt>MyCoolTemplate&lt;Type2&gt;</tt>, and <tt>MyCoolTemplate&lt;Type3&gt;</tt>
            in your binary - that's 3 instantiations. So the compiler will spit out 3 copies of this code, one per type T that was used as a
            template parameter. Each of them contains some bytes of assembly code. Then, the linker will come in later and fold together any of
            these that have identical bodies. But, what happens if the bodies are 95% the same bytes of assembly code, with a small difference due
            to the type T? Then no folding occurs, and you "waste" 95% of each copy by triplicating it. Bummer.
        </p>

        <p>
            So to add to the example above, imagine that <tt>Type1, Type2, and Type3</tt> look like this:
        </p>

        <pre>
    class Type1 {
    public:
      int someField;
      bool someFlag;
    };

    class Type2 {
    public:
      bool someFlag;
      int someField;
      bool someOtherFlag;
    };

    class Type3 {
    public:
      bool yetAnotherFlag;
      int someField;
    };
        </pre>

        <p>
            Then what'll happen is <tt>MyCoolTemplate&lt;Type2&gt;</tt> and <tt>MyCoolTemplate&lt;Type3&gt;</tt> will fold together perfectly as the offset
            of "someField" is identical, so the offset that gets put into the assemlby is the same. But <tt>MyCoolTemplate&lt;Type1&gt;</tt> will not fold,
            since someField is at another offset so the number of bytes that must be offset from "y" to find "someField" is different.
        </p>

        <p>
            Again, this is extremely difficult to see from just reading code as you must know the layouts of every type involved, the layout of any vtables
            called, the order of the vfptrs, and so on.
        </p>

        <p>
            Enter SizeBench's Template Foldability analysis! SizeBench will examine all templated functions in the binary, see which ones fold together,
            and tell you a few things about each template:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>What is the total cost of this templated function across all instantiations?</li>
            <li>How many symbols are there (how many times was the template expanded)?</li>
            <li>How many of those symbols are at unique addresses after COMDAT folding, dead code is stripped out, and so on?</li>
            <li>How similar are the instantiations to each other (0-100%)?</li>
            <li>What is the amount of "waste" in those similar parts across all those unique copies?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Example in SizeBench UI</h3>

        <p>
            Below we'll walk through an example found in an open source part of Chromium-based Edge.
        </p>

        <p>
            After opening this binary in SizeBench and clicking on Template Foldability, this is what we see:
        </p>

        <img src="Images/TemplateFoldability_Anaheim_Overview.png" width=800 />

        <p>
            The highlighted row is the template we'll look at. As you can see from the screenshot, SizeBench says this templated function takes up around
            40 KB in the binary, and each copy is 94% similar to the others - so 37.6 KB is considered "waste" in that it's duplicated bytes of code. This
            is across 463 copies of the template being instantiated, and after all folding 364 of them ended up being unique.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that SizeBench cannot tell you the template's full name as this is not in the debugging information, so "&lt;T1&gt;" is used to mean "the
            first template parameter." The names throughout the Template Foldability analysis are all anonymized like this with T1, T2, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            After clicking on that template we drill in to see this page:
        </p>

        <img src="Images/TemplateFoldability_Anaheim_MojoValidateStruct.png" width=800 />

        <p>
            This shows a diff of the disassembly from two instantiations of the template, each of which is 112 bytes (you can see that in the drop-down
            ComboBoxes). You can pick any two instantiations that you like, but by default the first two that match in size are chosen.
        </p>

        <p>
            The disassembly is identical for the first 53 lines, so this view automatically scrolled to line 54 to show us that this single "call" instruction
            is the only thing different between these two 112-byte template instantiations. If we want to see exactly which line of source code this line of
            assembly came from, we can just scroll to the right to see this:
        </p>

        <img src="Images/TemplateFoldability_Anaheim_MojoValidateStruct_LineNumber.png" width=800 />

        <p>
            So we can see that validation_util.h line 172 is the line that is doing something dependent on type T. Let's take a look at validation_util.h as 
            it was at this time, for this templated function. It looked like this:
        </p>

        <pre>
    163  template &lt;typename T&gt;
    164  bool ValidateStruct(const Pointer&lt;T&gt;& input,
    165                      ValidationContext* validation_context) {
    166    ValidationContext::ScopedDepthTracker depth_tracker(validation_context);
    167    if (validation_context-&gt;ExceedsMaxDepth()) {
    168      ReportValidationError(validation_context,
    169                            VALIDATION_ERROR_MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH);
    170      return false;
    171    }
    172    return ValidatePointer(input, validation_context) &&
    173           T::Validate(input.Get(), validation_context);
    174  }
        </pre>

        <p>
            Wow, this template is only 5-8 lines long, depending on how you like to count them. Let's call it 8. Yet it takes 40 KB of the binary! We can see there's
            some validation code at the top to instantiate a <tt>ScopedDepthTracker</tt>, check if it exceeds a max depth, report an error, and so on - all this code is 
            identical for each of the "T" types used to expand this template. The real difference is on line 172 where the <tt>T::Validate</tt> function is called. It makes 
            sense that this is unique to each type T as it's a direct call - perhaps in some cases it can inline and end up with identical bytes, so some copies fold,
            but in general this does not fold together.
        </p>

        <p>
            What can be done about this? Let's take a look in the next section.
        </p>

        <h3>How To Fix These</h3>

        <p>
            Let's continue with the example above - how can we fix this, or at least improve it? There's a few techniques you could use:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Add an interface for the <tt>Validate</tt> function, such as "<tt>IValidatable</tt>" and then have the template call the virtual function <tt>IValidatable::Validate(...)</tt>.
                This has the disadvantage of adding an indirect call, reducing the ability to inline, and other CPU perf characteristics - but for code that's not particularly hot may be
                the simplest way. In this case in Chromium this was not acceptable for security reasons.</li>
            <li>Have each <tt>T::Validate</tt> be foldable, as then each "call" in the template above would call the same address so they'd fold - this can be done for some types of problems,
                but is difficult to maintain.</li>
            <li>Separate out the foldable part, in this case the validation code, into a <tt>__declspec(noinline)</tt> function to prevent it from being inlined back into the template.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The actual change done by Emily Andrews on the Edge team <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/bebb5c663a5d32b21ab72a1599c036fb988390e6%5E%21/">can be seen here</a>.
            Now the template looks like this:
        </p>

        <pre>
    171  template &lt;typename T&gt;
    172  bool ValidateStruct(const Pointer&lt;T&gt;& input,
    173                      ValidationContext* validation_context) {
    174    ValidationContext::ScopedDepthTracker depth_tracker(validation_context);
    175    return ValidateParams(input, validation_context) &&
    176           T::Validate(input.Get(), validation_context);
    177  }
        </pre>

        <p>
            And <tt>ValidateParams</tt> looks like this:
        </p>

        <pre>
    149  template &lt;typename T&gt;
    150  bool ValidateParams(const Pointer&lt;T&gt;& input,
    151                      ValidationContext* validation_context) {
    152    if (validation_context-&gt;ExceedsMaxDepth()) {
    153      ReportValidationError(validation_context,
    154                            VALIDATION_ERROR_MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH);
    155      return false;
    156    }
    157    return ValidatePointer(input, validation_context);
    158  }
        </pre>

        <p>
            In this case, the <tt>ValidateParams</tt> template is not marked as <tt>__declspec(noinline)</tt>, though that would be my recommendation in cases like this in case
            the inliner gets more aggressive later. In this case, it happened to not inline, so the <tt>ValidateStruct</tt> templates shrunk a lot per copy, and the 
            <tt>ValidateParams&lt;T&gt;</tt> template perfectly folded down to one copy.
        </p>

        <h3>Other Examples</h3>

        <p>
            There are a few more examples of using Template Foldability that are internal to Microsoft, unfortunately not in OSS'd code.  If you are a Microsoft employee, you
            can visit here: <a href="https://aka.ms/sizebench-ms-internal-template-foldability-examples">MS Internal Template Foldability examples</a>.

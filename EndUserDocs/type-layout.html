        <h2>Type Layout</h2>

        <p>
            SizeBench enables you to view the in-memory layout of types in your code.  This can be valuable because of data alignment rules (discussed below) which can lead to non-obvious padding
            between members, sometimes quite a bit of it.  For types that are used in very hot paths, or allocated frequently, or types that are in large constant arrays in the binary, reducing
            this padding waste can sometimes yield significant improvements in CPU (due to data locality), memory usage, or disk footprint.
        </p>

        <p>
            To begin, you can either enter the full name of a type in the box, or you can use the "*" wildcard to look for multiple types, such as "Foo*" to find all types
            beginning with Foo.  Note that SizeBench uses the fully-qualified version of a type's name, including the namespace, so you could also use wildcards to look
            for all types in a namespace by searching for something like "myNamespace::*".  After you enter the name you want, simply hit the "View Layout(s)" button.
        </p>

        <p>
            What's returned is a tree view showing each type that matches the name pattern given.  Each type shows its full size, as well as how much "waste" SizeBench
            sees.  The waste is shown both exclusive-to a type (just the data members of that type, not including any base types) and also inclusively with all base types.
            For details on exactly what this waste is and how you can remove it, see more on data alignment and specific examples below.

        <h3><a id="data-alignment">Data Alignment</a></h3>
        <p>
            Data alignment is a very important topic in modern CPUs that are heavily memory bandwidth constrained.  There is a high-level description
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment">on Wikipedia</a> that's worth reading.  In short, each field within a type must, by default, be aligned in some way.
            Each primitive type has a specific alignment requirement, which differs by CPU architecture.
        </p>

        <p>
            For example, 'char' has an alignment requirement of 1 byte, while 'short' has an alignment requirement of 2 bytes.  This means that a simple structure that looks like this:
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
            <pre>
    struct Simple {
        char x;
        short y;
        char z;
    };
            </pre>
        </p>

        <p>
            Then you might expect this struct to be 4 bytes in size - two one-byte characters and a 2-byte short.  However, the layout in-memory will look like this, resulting in 6 bytes:
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
            <pre>
    struct Simple {
        char x;    // offset: 0
        [padding]  // offset: 1
        short y;   // offset: 2
        char z;    // offset: 4
        [padding]  // offset: 5
    };
            </pre>
        </p>

        <p>
            Why is this the case?  What is this padding?  Well, the 'x' char is straightforward - it's at offset 0 at the top of the struct and takes up one byte.  So far so good.  But the 'y'
            short member by default needs to be 2-byte aligned, meaning its address must be divisible by 2.  So it can't be placed at offset 1 right after the x member, instead an empty byte of padding
            is left there so 'y' is at offset 2.  The 'z' char has a 1-byte alignment requirement, so it can happily live at any byte and is at offset 4 right after the short, as you might expect.
            The final piece of the puzzle is this last byte of padding - why is that there?  Because types by default are rounded up in size to the largest alignment of any member, in this case that is 2
            (for the short).  This is so that if you have an array of these structs, each instance in that otherwise-tightly-packed array keeps required alignments for each instance in the array.<br />
            <br />
            SizeBench calls alignment between members "&lt;alignment padding&gt;" and alignment at the end of a type "&lt;tail slop alignment padding&gt;"
        </p>

        <h4><a id="reduce-by-rearranging-members">One way to reduce this - rearranging members</a></h4>
        <p>
            So, if you want to reduce the size of this example Simple type, you can re-arrange the members like so, resulting in only 4 bytes of memory for the struct as was likely intended:
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
            <pre>
    struct Simple {
        short y;  // offset: 0
        char x;   // offset: 2
        char z;   // offset: 3
    };
    static_assert(sizeof(Simple) == 4, "Simple has no padding");
            </pre>
        </p>

        <p>
            This basically puts 'z' into the byte that used to be empty padding.  The 'y' member is at offset zero which satisfies all possibile alignment requirements.
            This also eliminates the tail slop padding at the end of the type because the 4 bytes of the type are an even multiple of 2, the highest alignment requirement of any member.
            As a rule of thumb, sorting the members of a struct or class from largest to smallest will generally give good results because smaller types have some ability to fit into
            the padding created by larger types.  <tt>static_assert</tt> combined with <tt>sizeof()</tt> and <tt>offsetof()</tt> can be helpful because they will get the compiler to
            check the expectations for the memory alignment every time the code is compiled.
        </p>

        <p>
            Two bytes may not seem like it's much to worry about, and indeed in many cases it's not.  But if this type were used in a very critical hot loop with, say, thousands or millions of copies
            being examined, this could greatly improve performance.  Most modern CPUs have a cache line of 64 bytes, so by moving from 6 bytes to 4 bytes, this allows the cache line to hold 16 copies of
            this struct instead of 10.  This may also significantly reduce memory usage if there are many thousands or millions of these in your program.  If you had a large read-only array of these in
            your binary, it could also reduce disk footprint noticeably by having that large array be more tightly packed.  And of course this example is simple with only a few members and a few bytes
            of padding - in some codebases with larger types there can be dozens or hundreds of bytes of padding per instance of some commonly used structures.
        </p>

        <h4><a id="reduce-by-using-pragma-pack">Another way to fix this - #pragma pack push/pop</a></h4>
        <p>
            Another way to reduce the size of types is by using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/preprocessor/pack?view=msvc-160">#pragma pack</a>.  Be careful when using this, as it can
            cause un-aligned memory accesses.  On some CPU architectures this may result in a noticeable performance hit, depending on how the data is used.  But in some circumstances, this memory savings
            is worthwhile, or those performance penalties may not apply to the way the data is used.  Be sure to test performance when using this option to understand any trade-offs that may be at play.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thus, you could change the Simple type above to look like this:
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
            <pre>
    #pragma pack(push, 1)
    struct Simple {
        char x;    // offset: 0
        short y;   // offset: 1
        char z;    // offset: 3
    };
    #pragma pack(pop)
            </pre>
        </p>


        <h4><a id="alignment-between-bitfields">Why is this alignment here between bitfields?</a></h4>
        <p>
            Sometimes alignment is non-obvious.  As an example, consider this code:
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
            <pre>
    struct Simple {
        char x : 2;
        unsigned int y : 30;
    };
            </pre>
        </p>

        <p>
            You might expect this to be exactly 4 bytes (32 bits) because there are two bitfields specified precisely - unfortunately, this is not true.  The underlying types need to match when
            two bitfields are next to each other, or else they won't collapse into the same memory slot.  So in this case, the memory layout will look like this:
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
            <pre>
    struct Simple {
        char x : 2;          // offset: 0
        [padding] : 30;      // offset: 2 bits
        unsigned int y : 30; // offset: 2 bytes
        [padding] : 2;       // offset: 2 bytes + 30 bits
    };
            </pre>
        </p>

        <p>
            The fix here is to match underlying types, so if 'x' is changed into an unsigned int (still 2 bits), then these will fold as expected into one single 32-bit value.  This comes up a lot
            when mixing bool bitfields and integer bitfields in many codebases.
        </p>


        <h3><a id="visualization-and-exports">SizeBench type layout visualization and exports</a></h3>
        <p>
            When showing a type layout in SizeBench, it will be visualized as a tree view, to aid with two things:
            <ul>
                <li>Seeing how base types contribute to total size</li>
                <li>Seeing how members expand, if they are non-trivial types themselves with multiple members</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Once you are viewing a type's layout, the members will be shown as hyperlinks when they are non-primitive types.  You can click that hyperlink to load the layout of that type, if you want
            to start at a big type and then drill in to a specific member's type on its own.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can export to Excel in this view as in many other places in SizeBench - but it doesn't make so much sense to try to export each member or a tree view to a tabular data model like
            Excel.  Instead, the export just lists the bytes of padding (exclusive, and including base types), as well as how many bytes are spent on vfptrs (exclusive, and including base types).
            Thus, one handy way to use this tool is to put "*" into the search box, load the layouts for every type in the entire binary, then export to Excel and begin to sort and spelunk around for
            types with high amounts of alignment waste, or with a high % of their total size being waste.
        </p>




        <h3><a id="example-windows-terminal-ROW">Example: Windows Terminal ROW structure</a></h3>
        <img class="screenshot" src="Images/TypeLayout_WindowsTerminal_ROW.png" width=600 />
        <p>
            Let's take a look at an example of a more complex type than the simple ones used to describe alignment above.  In the screenshot to the right, SizeBench
            has been loaded up with a binary from <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal">Windows Terminal</a>.  If you'd like to follow along at home, you
            can clone the Terminal repo from GitHub and go to commit <tt>10222a2b</tt>, where this example was built.  The repo has instructions for how to clone and
            build everything - do that and build an x64 Release binary, then load the OpenConsole.exe/.pdb in SizeBench and you should see identical information to
            what's shown in these screenshots.
        </p>

        <p>
            We open OpenConsole.exe/.pdb and go to the Type Layout view, then search for "ROW" to see the screenshot to the right.  This type is a good example because
            it's relatively simple, yet still has members with complex types.  At the very top of the tree view it says this:<br />
            <div style="margin-left: 50px;">ROW (size: 472, waste exclusive: 6, waste incl. base types: 6)</div>
            <br />
            This means that each instance of ROW takes up 472 bytes, and in those 472 bytes there are a total of 6 bytes of wasted alignment.  All of that alignment is exclusive
            to this type, none comes from base types - which makes sense, as ROW does not have any base types anyway.  This amount of alignment waste is quite good, as this
            structure has 8-byte alignment requirements so wasting 6 bytes is very close to optimal, it could only be lower if it was zero.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each member is listed beginning with "this+[some number] [type]" which shows in-memory how far offset from the start of the type this member is stored, and what
            type that member is. For example, at the very beginning of the class is <tt>_charRow</tt> which is 0 bytes from the start of the class (this+000), and is of
            type <tt>CharRow</tt>.  An instance of <tt>CharRow</tt> is 400 bytes, so the second member <tt>_attrRow</tt> shows as "this+400" because that member begins 400 bytes
            into the class in-memory.  This cotinues down for every member of the type until the final one <tt>_pParent</tt> which is a pointer to a <tt>TextBuffer</tt> that begins
            464 bytes in.
        </p>

        <p>
            Right after the <tt>_doubleBytePadded</tt> field there are 6 bytes of alignment waste.  This is because <tt>_doubleBytePadded</tt> begins at this+457, and is just one byte
            long.  However, the next member <tt>_pParent</tt> is a pointer, and for a 64-bit binary like this, pointers need to be 64-bit aligned, or 8-byte aligned.  So even though
            there is unused space at this+458, it cannot be used to hold this pointer while satisfying alignment requirements - padding space is left until this+464, as 464 is the next
            offset divisible by 8.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is good to know, as the next time data needs to be added to this type, it would be ideal to add it right after <tt>_doubleBytePadded</tt>, into that blank padding space,
            which could prevent increasing the size of this type even if additional state is stored.
        </p>

        <br style="clear:right;" />

        <br />

        <img class="screenshot" src="Images/TypeLayout_WindowsTerminal_ROW_CharRowExpanded.png" width=600 />
        <p>
            So this type takes up 472 bytes in total, and 400 of those are in the CharRow member named <tt>_charRow</tt>.  If you expand that tree view node, you can see where those 400
            bytes go.  This next screenshot shows that.  In this case, <tt>CharRow</tt> has two members - a <tt>small_vector</tt> that is 392 bytes and a pointer back to the ROW that is
            8 bytes.  You could further expand the <tt>small_vector</tt> and recursively understand where each byte exactly comes from.
        </p>

        <br style="clear:right" />

        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        <h3><a id="example-windows-terminal-FontInfo">Example: Windows Terminal FontInfo structure</a></h3>
        <img class="screenshot" src="Images/TypeLayout_WindowsTerminal_FontInfo.png" width=600 />

        <p>
            Here's another example from <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal">Windows Terminal</a>.  As above, if you'd like to follow along at home, you
            can clone the Terminal repo from GitHub and go to commit <tt>10222a2b</tt>, where this example was built.  The repo has instructions for how to clone and
            build everything - do that and build an x64 Release binary, then load the OpenConsole.exe/.pdb in SizeBench and you should see identical information to
            what's shown in these screenshots.
        </p>

        <p>
            This class is called <tt>FontInfo</tt> and it's interesting because it has a base class, where <tt>ROW</tt> in the example above is simpler with no base type.  When looking at
            FontInfo, SizeBench says this:<br />
            <div style="margin-left: 50px;">FontInfo (size: 64, waste exclusive: 7, waste incl. base types: 13)</div>
            <br />
            This means that the <tt>FontInfo</tt> type on its own has 7 bytes of alignment waste throughout.  Its base type, <tt>FontInfoBase</tt> has an additional 6 bytes of padding waste, so
            in total this means the type has 13 bytes of waste.
        </p>

        <p>
            The member view is much like the <tt>ROW</tt> example above, so this example won't go into detail there.  But, notice the base type being listed in the tree view near the top - this is
            to show that the base type's data is also part of the memory utilized by an instance of <tt>FontInfo</tt>.  Here it shows that <tt>FontInfoBase</tt> accounts for 48 bytes of space, of
            the 64 bytes total used by each <tt>FontInfo</tt>.  Beyond the base type, <tt>FontInfo</tt> adds a couple of <tt>_COORD</tt> members, a boolean, and then some alignment padding.
        </p>

        <br style="clear:right;" />

        <br />

        <img class="screenshot" src="Images/TypeLayout_WindowsTerminal_FontInfo_FontInfoBaseExpanded.png" width=600 />
        <p>
            Once <tt>FontInfoBase</tt> is expanded, we can see that it has a <tt>std::basic_string</tt> (probably a <tt>std::wstring</tt>), a couple integers, a char, ad so forth in it.  It also
            contains a 'hole' of alignment padding between two members, and some slop at the end.  If the <tt>_fDefaultRasterSetFromEngine</tt> member were moved up, it could fit into the alignment
            'hole' - which may save space overall, depending on what the final alignment requirements are of the <tt>FontInfoBase</tt>.
        </p>

# Welcome to the SizeBench repo

This repository contains the SizeBench tool for doing size analysis of PE files typically used on Windows.  It's intended to help with questions like:

* Why is this binary so big?
* What can be done to make it smaller?

### If you're a user of the tool
You can get help by opening SizeBench and going to Help > Show Help.  Or, in this repo the usage docs are in the [EndUserDocs](/EndUserDocs) folder.

For an introduction to this tool, see the [announcement blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/performance-diagnostics/sizebench-a-new-tool-for-analyzing-windows-binary-size/)

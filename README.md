# Welcome to the SizeBench repo

This repository contains the SizeBench tool for doing size analysis of [PE files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format) (Portable Executables such as DLL, EXE,
and SYS files) typically used on Windows.  It's intended to help with questions like:

* Why is this binary so big?
* What can be done to make it smaller?

## If you're a user of the tool
You can get help by opening SizeBench and going to Help > Show Help.  Or, in this repo the usage docs are in the [EndUserDocs](/EndUserDocs) folder.

For an introduction to this tool, see the [announcement blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/performance-diagnostics/sizebench-a-new-tool-for-analyzing-windows-binary-size/)

### Quick Start

Install SizeBench [from the Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NDF4N1WG7D6).

Launch it from the start menu, then select `Examine a Binary` to pick a PE file and its symbols.  Or select `Start a diff` to pick a "before" PE with its
symbols and an "after" PE with its symbols.

On the command line, use `sizebench.exe mybinary.exe mysymbols.pdb` to analyze a single binary, or `sizebench.exe ..\baseline\mybinary.exe ..\baseline\pdb\mybinary.pdb mybinary.exe .\pdb\mybinary.pdb`
to start a comparison session.

The next expected work should be roughly this:

1. Move to GitHub Actions for CI and PR pipelines.
1. Create and publish NuGet package for the Analysis Engine.
1. Support diffing of SourceFiles.
1. Support diffing of Inline Sites.
1. Improved support for binaries containing Rust code.
